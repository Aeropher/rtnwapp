Now I know that there is simply no such thing, but I am having a go at making something that will work for me and I hope it works for more people as well.</p><p>This project fulfills a few goals for me:</p><p>I get to make an actual app on the app store(s). I get my own custom todo app that should work for me the way I want it to. I get to learn about technologies that are quite far outside of my usual day job. I get to have fun in my own nerdy way.</p><p>This whole project is pretty cool for me :-)</p>"

I think it gave me a good way to learn about a technology that I think is going to be revolutionary.</p><p>Like with most technologies, once the cat is out of the bag, it can't be put back in. And I think if I don't get to grips with it, then I will be falling behind not just in my career but in life.</p><p>So I hope you don't mind my use of AI. And if you are interested in hearing more about how and why I use it, then just let me know... Somehow... I'm not sure how you can reach me just yet but I will make it possible lol.</p>"
