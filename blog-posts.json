Now I know that there is simply no such thing but I am having a go at making something that will work for me and I hope it works for more people as well.</p><p>This project fulfils a few goals for me. I get to make an actual app on the app store(s), I get my own custom todo app that should work for me the way I want it to. I get to learn about technologies that are quite far outside of my usual day job. I get to have fun in my own nerdy way. This whole project is pretty cool for me :-)</p>"
