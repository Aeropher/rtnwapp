Now I know that there is simply no such thing, but I am having a go at making something that will work for me and I hope it works for more people as well.</p><p>This project fulfills a few goals for me:</p><p>I get to make an actual app on the app store(s). I get my own custom todo app that should work for me the way I want it to. I get to learn about technologies that are quite far outside of my usual day job. I get to have fun in my own nerdy way.</p><p>This whole project is pretty cool for me :-)</p>"

      "content": "<p>AI.</p><p>I am pretty torn about the use and the implications of AI on the world.</p><p>I use AI very liberally in this project, and it's another reason I wanted to do this project. I think it gave me a good way to learn about a technology that I think is going to be revolutionary.</p><p>Like with most technologies, once the cat is out of the bag, it can't be put back in. And I think if I don't get to grips with it, then I will be falling behind not just in my career but in life.</p><p>So I hope you don't mind my use of AI. And if you are interested in hearing more about how and why I use it, then just let me know... Somehow... I'm not sure how you can reach me just yet but I will make it possible lol.</p>"

      "content": "<p>The RightNow app is kind of born out of <a href=\"https://gettingthingsdone.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GTD (David Allen)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.scrum.org/\" target=\"_blank\">SCRUM (Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland)</a>, and the Time Blocking or <a href=\"https://calnewport.com/deep-work/\" target=\"_blank\">Deep Work principles of Cal Newport</a>.</p><p>I have been using Scrum in my professional life for over 10 years (gosh I am ageing) and in that time I have been playing around with many productivity systems. None of them work for me wholesale but they all have things that really work, so I combine them.</p><p>So the core idea of this app was to almost do a mini Sprint where we have a backlog of tasks and plan the tasks for the day based on the capacity that we have for the day.</p><p>The capacity is the real strength of this idea because you should be able to adapt your day based on what you actually have time for. The app should tell you when you don't have time to do everything and you can just kick a task back to the backlog to do the next day.</p><p>This should help with a feeling of accomplishment as well - you didn't fail to get everything done, there was simply not enough time to do it.</p><p>This idea of course means that the app needs to know how long a task will take to do and I have some ideas. Basically gamification of backlog grooming or refinement as it is now called.</p><p>We will get into that in a future post. :-D</p>"
